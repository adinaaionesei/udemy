        <h2>Usage of Headings</h2>
        <p>
            Headings are used to display title of the paragraph or show some text in bigger size and bolder.<br><br>

            There are 6 headings tags &#60;h1&#62; to &#60;h6&#62; <br><br>

            h1 is the bigger and h6 being the smallest.<br><br>

            Headings text tags are always big in size and use to grab attention of the user or show the purpose of the article.<br><br>

            The behavior of the headings can be change later using CSS which you will learn next.<br><br>

            Browser has a default settings to show headings.<br>

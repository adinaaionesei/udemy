        <h2>The Best Foods To Eat When It’s<br>
            Late Morning And You’re Ready For Lunch
        </h2>
        <h3><i>Mid-morning hunger is real. Here's how to keep it from derailing your entire day.</i></h3>
        <p><strong>By Leigh Weingus</strong></p>

        <p>“Our brains and bodies typically run through energy quickly in the mornings when efficiency
            and creativity are at their peak,” explained registered dietitian <a href="#">Tracy Lockwood Beckerman</a>.
            “This productivity burst can leave you feeling depleted and wanting to run to the kitchen for
            an early lunch.”

                <p><i>List</i></p>
                <p><strong>Snacks</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Banana topped with nut butter</li>
                    <li>Dark chocolate and nuts</li>
                    <li>A protein bar (but not just any protein bar)</li>
                    <li>Walnuts</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Options</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you’re still working from home, this is an easy mid-morning option.
                        “You always want snacks to include a protein or a healthy fat source,
                        not just a carbohydrate. This makes for better blood sugar stabilization
                        and increased fullness to hold you over until lunch,” explained registered
                        dietitian Abby Vichill. “Bananas have carbs, and nut butter has fat and protein.”
                    </li>
                    <li>Who can say no to 10 a.m. chocolate? Beckerman says that combining dark chocolate
                        with almonds, peanuts or even pumpkin seeds can help keep your blood sugar stable
                        while keeping you focused and productive. As a nice bonus, dark chocolate has a little
                        bit of caffeine in it.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are tons of protein bar options out there that are aimed toward keeping you full
                        and energized. Plus, they’re a great option if you’re back in an office and want something
                        quick and easy. Beckerman suggests R.E.D.D. bars, which are made with real ingredients like
                        hemp, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds and quinoa.
                    </li>
                    <li>An easy snack to grab whether you’re working from home or in an office, walnuts do more than
                        just stabilize blood sugar and keep you full until lunch, Beckerman says. “According to research,
                        eating walnuts may also improve memory and concentration in adults,” she said. “So if you’re
                        planning to continue your work grind, some crunchy and satisfying walnuts can help optimize your
                        productivity.”
